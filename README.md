# AI-Tic-Tac-Toe

Hi and thanks for stopping in to my ai-tic-tac-toe application. It's a simple design leveraging basic html and css, but the functionality is what's cool. Never Winning! Don't ya love the sound of that? The AI uses the power of the minimax algorithim to predict the best move it should make. The worst case scenario for the AI is a tie, but if the human player doesn't play optimally, the AI will swoop in and win. Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor!
